Progressive Learning Exercises for LangGraph and Knowledge Graphs

This module contains structured exercises that build from basic concepts
to advanced implementations, designed for beginner to advanced users.

To use these exercises:
1. Set up your environment with: pdm install
2. Load data with: pdm run load-data
3. Start with Level 1 exercises and progress through each level
4. Use the actual entity names from the database (TP53, BRCA1, Hypertension, Lisinopril, etc.)

Required imports for practical use:
```python
from src.agents.graph_interface import GraphInterface
from src.agents.workflow_agent import WorkflowAgent, WorkflowState
from src.agents.advanced_workflow_agent import AdvancedWorkflowAgent, AgentState
from src.agents.template_query_agent import TemplateQueryAgent
```
