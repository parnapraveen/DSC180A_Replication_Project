**Learn LangGraph and Knowledge Graphs through Biomedical AI**

An interactive educational project that teaches modern AI development through hands-on biomedical applications. Build AI agents that answer complex questions about genes, proteins, diseases, and drugs using graph databases and multi-step AI workflows.


## What You'll Learn

- **Knowledge Graphs**: Represent domain knowledge as nodes and relationships
- **LangGraph**: Build multi-step AI workflows with state management  
- **Cypher Queries**: Query graph databases effectively
- **AI Integration**: Combine language models with structured knowledge
- **Biomedical Applications**: Apply AI to drug discovery and personalized medicine

## Quick Start

1. **New to these concepts?** Read the [Foundations Guide](docs/foundations-and-background.md)
2. **Setup**: Follow [Getting Started](docs/getting-started.md) for installation
3. **Learn**: Use the interactive Streamlit web interface
4. **Practice**: Work through the exercises in the web app

## Technology Stack

- **LangGraph**: AI workflow orchestration
- **Neo4j**: Graph database
- **Anthropic Claude**: Language model
- **Streamlit**: Interactive web interface
- **LangGraph Studio**: Visual debugging

## Installation

**Quick Setup**: Python 3.10+, Neo4j, PDM

```bash
# Install dependencies
pdm install

# Setup environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your API keys

# Load data and start
pdm run load-data
pdm run app
```

## AI Agent

**WorkflowAgent** - LangGraph implementation with transparent processing for learning core LangGraph concepts through biomedical applications

## Example Questions

- **"Which drugs have high efficacy for treating diseases?"**
- **"Which approved drugs treat cardiovascular diseases?"**
- **"Which genes encode proteins that are biomarkers for diseases?"**
- **"What drugs target proteins with high confidence disease associations?"**
- **"Which approved drugs target specific proteins?"**
- **"Which genes are linked to multiple disease categories?"**
- **"What proteins have causal associations with diseases?"** 

## Evaluation Module - I ADDED THIS PART

### Note: This is starter code for adding evaluation metrics for each query. I have not made that much progress on this yet but the idea is to include node or system level evaluation metrics to help improve the system over time. 

### The system evaluates AI agent performance using four key metrics:

#### Classification Accuracy

Measures how well the agent identifies the intent of the user's question (e.g., distinguishing between gene-disease queries vs. drug-treatment queries). High classification accuracy ensures the agent follows the correct workflow path from the start.

#### Entity Accuracy

Measures how accurately the agent extracts key biomedical terms (e.g., "Hypertension," "Lisinopril," "Breast Cancer") from questions. This is foundational—if entities aren't correctly identified, the agent cannot construct precise database queries.

#### Answer Accuracy

Measures how well the agent's final generated answer matches the expected factual outcome. This is the ultimate end-to-end performance measure, confirming whether the entire workflow (classification → extraction → query generation → execution → formatting) produces correct results.

#### Average Query Duration 

Measures the time taken to execute each query, providing insight into system efficiency and user experience. This metric is critical for evaluating real-world performance and scalability.

### Together, these metrics provide granular insights into where the agent may be failing:

1. Low classification + high entity accuracy → LLM struggles with context selection but excels at term identification
2. High classification + entity accuracy but low answer accuracy → Issues in query generation or answer formatting


To evaluate the workflow agent:

```bash
pdm run python src/agents/evaluation_metrics.py
```

Expected output:

```
classification_accuracy: 0.64
entity_accuracy: 0.64
answer_accuracy: 0.36
average_query_duration_seconds: 38.34
```
