## 🎯 Progressive Learning Architecture

The project provides **three different agent implementations** to demonstrate various approaches:

### 🎓 **WorkflowAgent** (Primary - Used in Web App)
- **Educational LangGraph implementation** optimized for learning
- **5-step workflow**: Classify → Extract → Generate → Execute → Format
- **Transparent processing** with detailed comments and print statements
- **Perfect for understanding** core LangGraph concepts and biomedical AI

### 📚 **AdvancedWorkflowAgent** (Reference - Production Patterns)
- **Production-ready LangGraph** with advanced error handling and monitoring
- **Same core workflow** as WorkflowAgent but with enterprise features
- **Demonstrates evolution** from educational prototype to production system
- **Learn advanced patterns**: conditional routing, query validation, comprehensive logging
